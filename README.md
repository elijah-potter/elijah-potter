# Allow Me Introduce Myself

I am currently a computer science student at the Colorado School of Mines, as well as a software developer at [Archytas Automation](https://archytasinc.com/).
As such, most of my time is tied up in school or working on [HDI Harmony](https://hdiharmony.web.app), a no-code development environment for the Archytas Automation robot.

Most of my writing ends up on my [personal website](https://elijahpotter.dev).

In case your interested, my most recent side projects include: [Harper](https://github.com/chilipepperhott/harper), [The Thrax Programming Language](https://github.com/chilipepperhott/thrax-language), a ["Hope O' Meter"](https://elijahpotter.dev/articles/quantifying_hope_on_a_global_scale), [a number of short videos](https://elijahpotter.dev/videos) and a [software renderer I wrote from scratch](https://elijahpotter.dev/renderer).
