# Allow Me Introduce Myself

I am currently a computer science student at the Colorado School of Mines, as well as a software developer at [Tyler Technologies](https://www.tylertech.com/).
When I'm not occupied by those things, I'm usually working on [Harper](https://github.com/chilipepperhott/harper), a grammar checker for developers.

Most of my writing ends up on my [personal website](https://elijahpotter.dev).

In case you're interested, my other recent side projects include: [The Thrax Programming Language](https://github.com/chilipepperhott/thrax-language), a ["Hope O' Meter"](https://elijahpotter.dev/articles/quantifying_hope_on_a_global_scale), [a number of short videos](https://elijahpotter.dev/videos) and a [software renderer I wrote from scratch](https://elijahpotter.dev/renderer).
