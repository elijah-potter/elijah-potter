# Allow Me Introduce Myself

I am currently a Software Engineer at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) working on [Harper](https://writewithharper.com), a grammar checker. 
I joined after it was [acquired by the company](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/21/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-snaps-up-grammar-checker-harper/).

Most of my writing ends up on my [personal website](https://elijahpotter.dev).
